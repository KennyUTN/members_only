## About The Project

This project consists of using the [Devise gem](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise) to have a first approach at authentication in rails. It is an application that allows users to create posts and the authors of the posts are displayed only if, you as a User, are logged in.


## Installation

To have this app on your pc, you need to:
* have Ruby & Ruby on Rails installed in your computer
* clone this repo:
  - Clone with SSH:
  ```
    git@github.com:KennyUTN/members-only.git
  ```
  - Clone with HTTPS
  ```
    https://github.com/KennyUTN/members-only.git
  ```
* and open the terminal inside the repository and run the bundler
  - ```$ bundle install```
* then, run rails db:migrate. This creates the database with the corresponding tables, columns and associations
  - ```$ rails db:migrate```
* and finally, you can test it in the console by running
  - ```$ rails server``` and using ```localhost:3000``` into your browser address bar to start using it


## Usage
